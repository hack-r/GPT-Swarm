2023-11-28 00:47:31,475 - GPTSwarmLogger - INFO - Task 'Here is a revised version of the answer:

Below is a Python code that lists all prime numbers between 3001 and 3500:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1 or (n % 2 == 0 and n > 2): 
        return False
    return all(n % i for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2))

prime_numbers = [n for n in range(3001, 3500) if is_prime(n)]
prime_numbers_str = ", ".join(str(num) for num in prime_numbers)
prime_numbers_str

```
The code defines a function `is_prime(n)` to check if a number `n` is prime. It then generates a list of prime numbers between 3001 and 3500 by iterating over this range and filtering the numbers using the `is_prime` function. Finally, the code converts the list of prime numbers into a string format (comma-separated) and outputs it.
