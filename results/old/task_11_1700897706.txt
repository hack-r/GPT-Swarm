"In R, you can create a stopwatch using the `Sys.time` function, which returns the current system time. Here is how you can do it:\n\n```R\n# To start the stopwatch\nstart.time <- Sys.time()\n\n#... here you put the code you want to time\n\n# To stop the stopwatch and print the elapsed time\nend.time <- Sys.time()\nelapsed.time <- end.time - start.time\nprint(elapsed.time)\n```\n\nIf you want to convert the elapsed time to minutes, you can use the `as.difftime` function in R:\n\n```R\n# Convert the elapsed time to minutes\nelapsed.time.minutes <- as.difftime(elapsed.time, units=\"mins\")\nprint(elapsed.time.minutes)\n```\n\nPlease replace the comment **\"... here you put the code you want to time\"** with the code snippet that you want to measure execution time for. The stopwatch will calculate the time taken to run the code from beginning to the end."
