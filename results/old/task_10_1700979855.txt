"I'm sorry, but your request is a bit unclear. Could you please provide more information? Diagram updates can mean a lot of different things depending on the context, the programming language, and the specific software or library you're working with. \n\nIf you're asking about updating diagrams in a specific language or framework such as updating a chart in JavaScript with the chart.js library, or updating a UML diagram with a Java-based tool, or something else, please specify. Any additional details you can provide about the diagram (i.e., what kind of diagram, any specific requirements for the updates, etc.) would be very helpful in giving a more precise answer. \n\nIf you're not sure about any of these questions, feel free to share as many detail as you can about your problem or project, and I'll do my best to provide a helpful response."
