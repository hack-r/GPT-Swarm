"Below is a very simplified implementation of the Stopwatch module with the 'startStopwatch' and 'stopStopwatch' functions. Note that we are using system time to implement the stopwatch functionality. \n\n```R\n# define the `stopwatch` environment\nstopwatch <- new.env()\n\n# `startStopwatch` function\nstopwatch$startStopwatch <- function() {\n  return(Sys.time())\n}\n\n# `stopStopwatch` function\nstopwatch$stopStopwatch <- function(start_time) {\n  return(Sys.time() - start_time)\n}\n\n# `stopwatchOperation` function\nstopwatch$stopwatchOperation <- function(command, startTime = NA) {\n  if (command == \"start\") {\n    return(stopwatch$startStopwatch())\n  } else if (command == \"stop\") {\n    if (is.na(startTime)) {\n      stop(\"Start time is missing. Please provide the start time.\")\n    } else {\n      return(stopwatch$stopStopwatch(startTime))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n# example usage:\nstart_time <- stopwatch$stopwatchOperation(\"start\")\nSys.sleep(1) # pause for 1 second\nprint(stopwatch$stopwatchOperation(\"stop\", start_time)) \n```\nPlease replace 'Sys.sleep(1)' with your actual function or process that you want to measure the time for. The print function will print the time elapsed since the stopwatch was started, in seconds.\n\nNote:\n\n1) This stopwatch won't hold a state. Each call to 'startStopwatch' starts a new stopwatch and doesn't stop or affect any other.\n\n2) This is a very basic implementation and doesn't include error handling. In real-world use, you may want more robust error checks and corner case handling.\n\n3) 'stopStopwatch' expects 'startTime' to be a valid system time. Invalid or mismatched types may result in errors."
