"Indeed, R language is not specifically designed for network programming and it might not be the best tool for this task. Nonetheless, it's theoretically possible to write R code for that purpose. Here is an example of some robust R code for reading data from a file. This code accounts for possible errors such as no file found (commonly known as edge cases):\n\nKeep in mind that this is just an example and you'll likely need to use a more specialized package for your specific networking purpose. \n\nExample:\n\n```R\nread_securely <- function(file_path) {\n  # Error checking to confirm file exists\n  if (!file.exists(file_path)) {\n    stop(\"File does not exist!\")\n  }\n  \n  # Exception handling for reading the file\n  tryCatch({\n    data <- read.csv(file_path)\n    print('File read successfully.')\n    return(data)\n  },\n  warning = function(warning_condition) {\n    message(\"Warning: \", conditionMessage(warning_condition))\n    return(NULL) # Returns NULL if there was a warning\n  },\n  error = function(error_condition) {\n    message(\"Error: \", conditionMessage(error_condition))\n    return(NULL) # Returns NULL if there was an error\n  },\n  finally = {\n    message(\"Process complete.\")\n  })\n}\n```\n\nIt's important to understand that this function won't directly manipulate any network interfaces, but it gives you an idea about how one can make a function robust by adding error check and exception handling. As you mentioned, in order to interact directly with network interfaces, more sophisticated and lower level libraries and languages such as Python, C or C++ would be more suitable."
