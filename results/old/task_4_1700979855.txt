"Sure, a simple way of handling errors in R is by using tryCatch function. Here is an example of using tryCatch for error handling and debugging during real-time network monitoring.\n\n```r\n# Function to simulate network monitoring\nnetwork_monitoring <- function(url) {\n if(!httr::http_error(url)){\n     response <- httr::GET(url)\n     httr::content(response)\n } else {\n   print(\"Unable to fetch data.\")\n }\n}\n\n# URL for monitoring\nurl <- \"http://example.com\"\n\n# Error handling\nresult <- tryCatch({\n    network_monitoring(url)\n}, warning = function(warning_condition) {\n    print(paste(\"Warning:\", conditionMessage(warning_condition)))\n}, error = function(error_condition) {\n    print(paste(\"Error:\", conditionMessage(error_condition)))\n}, finally = {\n    print(\"Network monitoring task completed.\")\n})\n```\nIn the code provided above, we have a function `network_monitoring` that would make a network request to a given URL. In the main code, this function is wrapped inside a `tryCatch` block.\n\nIf there is any issue with the network request, executing the function would result in an error, triggering the corresponding error block in the `tryCatch` statement to handle it. Similarly, any warnings triggered during the execution would be handled as well.\n\nThe \"finally\" block is executed after all the statements inside the tryCatch block, regardless of whether there was an error or not. It's mostly used for cleanup code, but in this case, I used it to print a message indicating that the network monitoring task was completed. \n\nPlease replace \"http://example.com\" with the url that you want to monitor. The function only prints out if a request is successful or not. If you need more complex error and exception handling, it would be better to consider using more powerful tools like debugger packages."
