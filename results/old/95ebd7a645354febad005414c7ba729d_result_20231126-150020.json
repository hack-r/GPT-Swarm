"Verse 1:\nIn each golden curve, a taste sensation\nBringing to life the essence of creation \nArby's, it all starts with the sauce so divine,\nRich tangy texture, flavors that intertwine. \n\nVerse 2:\nThe aroma so inviting, whispers stories untold,\nEach bite unwinds, its magic unfold. \nWith each tender drip on sandwich it falls,\nNarrates the heart of Arby's through the halls.\n\nVerse 3:\nTo the crunch of each landscape, it brings a rhyme,\nPainting a melody, one frame at a time.\nIt's not just a meal, it's an Arby's affair,\nA song of flavor crafted with care.\n\nChorus:\nTaste, texture, aroma in every bite, \nArby's sauce, making everything right \nIn its swirls and strokes the stories arise, \nThe soul of Arby's, the flavor never lies.\n\nVerse 4:\nAnd to think of Arby's with no sauce near,\nThe world would be devoid, nothing to cheer.\nFor in each drop of this saccharine nectar,\nLies the indispensable Arby's vector.\n\nVerse 5:\nIn the dawn of craving or twilight's close,\nIt's the taste of Arby's sauce we chose.\nFelt in the heart, savored on the tongue,\nThe melody of Arby's sauce, forever sung. \n\nChorus (repeat):\nTaste, texture, aroma in every bite, \nArby's sauce, making everything right \nIn its swirls and strokes the stories arise, \nThe soul of Arby's, the flavor never lies."
