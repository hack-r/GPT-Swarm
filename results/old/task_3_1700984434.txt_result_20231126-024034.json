"It seems like you need help generating a random melody. Here are two ways of doing it: using notes from a scale like the C Major (C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C) or using MIDI notes numbers (from 21 to 108). For this example, I will use the C Major scale.\n\nOne way to do it is to use a programming language like Python to generate a random melody. This can be done using the random library to randomly select notes from the C Major scale.\n\nExample using Python: \n\n```Python\nimport random\n\n# Define the C Major scale\nc_major = ['C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'A', 'B', 'C']\n\n# Generate a random melody\nmelody = [random.choice(c_major) for _ in range(8)]\n\nprint(' '.join(melody))\n```\nNote that the above Python code prints 8 randomly chosen notes from the C Major scale. This will create a simple, random melody for a chorus.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot actually generate the sound of the melody here as I'm a text-based interface. You'd need a library or a framework that allows you to play the generated melody. Depending on your project you might want to consider libraries such as MIDIUtil, Music21, or PyDub in Python or using web based tech like JavaScript's Tone.js or Web Audio API."
