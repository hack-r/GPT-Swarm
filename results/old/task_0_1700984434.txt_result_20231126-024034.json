"That seems to be a request related to songwriting rather than code writing. Nevertheless, I'd be glad to help. \n\nThe theme of a song is the central topic or motif. Here are a few themes which are popular in songwriting:\n\n1. Love and Relationships: This is perhaps the most popular theme in songs. It can include the excitement of love, heartbreak, longing, unrequited love, etc.\n\n2. Life Struggles: Songs often tell stories about life's hardships, challenges and overcoming them. They may deal with personal or social issues.\n\n3. Life's Joys: Celebrations, parties, happiness, and contentment - these all fall under this theme.\n\n4. Nature and Environment: Some songs speak of the beauty of nature, or voice concerns about environmental issues.\n\n5. Adventure and Travel: These songs take the listener on a journey, both physically and metaphorically, reflecting the thrill and experiences associated with adventures and explorations.\n\n6. Spirituality and Faith: These songs express ideas of belief, worship, doubts and inner soul searching.\n\n7. Growth and Change: This theme covers transitions, learning, personal growth and development.\n\n8. Nostalgia: Songs that reminisce about the past, the good old days, childhood memories, etc.\n\nRemember, the best themes for songs are those that create a connection with the listener, evoke emotions, and provide a fresh point of view or comment on everyday events and experiences."
