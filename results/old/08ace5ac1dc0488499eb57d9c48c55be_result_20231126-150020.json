"(Chorus)\nOh, Arby's sauce, you spice up my meal,\nWith your tangy twist, I can't help but feel,\nEvery bite I take, you make it so real,\nArby's sauce, you've got that irresistible appeal.\n\nOh, Arby's sauce, in you I trust,\nYou turn every meal into a gust of gust,\nYour flavor ride's always a must,\nArby's sauce, you're the secret to every crust."
