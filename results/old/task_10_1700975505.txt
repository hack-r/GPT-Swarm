"In R, there is no built-in functionality to interact with Wi-Fi networks as it is not within the typical scope of a data analysis and statistical programming language. You could however potentially call an external command or script written in another language that performs this operation. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that this exceeds the standard and recommended use of R as a data analysis tool, and may not be a good practice based on your system administration and security policies. \n\nIf you are using R programming within a Linux or OS X environment, you can manage network connections using system commands such as `system(\"networksetup -setairportpower en0 off\")` to turn off Wi-Fi and `system(\"networksetup -setairportpower en0 on\")` to turn it back on. Please replace `en0` with your actual network adapter. This solution is not portable and assumes that your R session has the necessary permissions to execute this command.\n\nPlease consult your system or network administrator before attempting system-level operations."
