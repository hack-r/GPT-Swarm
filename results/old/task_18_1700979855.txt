"Creating a network monitoring script in R involves several pieces. First, you need a way to gather network data. If this was a real-world scenario, you might need a package or library that has access to your particular network and its details, but that's outside the scope of R and would likely involve other languages or tools. However, we can simulate this with a simple function that generates random network data.\n\nNext is graphing the data. We'll use the popular ggplot2 package for this, which provides an easy-to-use and powerful interface for creating graphs from data.\n\nLastly, the function needs to periodically regenerate the data and the graph. There's no built-in way in R to run a function 'every so often', but we can simulate this with a for loop that pauses for a certain amount of time in between each iteration.\n\nHere is the code that fulfills the above requirements:\n\n```r\n# Required Libraries\ninstall.packages(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Function to generate random network data\ngenerate_network_data <- function() {\n  data.frame(\n    Time = Sys.time(),\n    NetworkActivity = rnorm(1, mean = 50, sd = 10)\n  )\n}\n\n# Function to plot the network data\nplot_network_data <- function(data) {\n  ggplot(data, aes(x = Time, y = NetworkActivity)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    labs(title = \"Network Activity Over Time\", x = \"Time\", y = \"Network Activity\")\n}\n\n# Monitor network function\nmonitor_network <- function(duration, delay) {\n  start_time <- Sys.time()\n  network_data <- generate_network_data()\n  \n  while (Sys.time() - start_time < duration) {\n    Sys.sleep(delay)\n    new_data <- generate_network_data()\n    network_data <- rbind(network_data, new_data)\n    print(plot_network_data(network_data))\n  }\n}\n\n# Calling the monitoring function for monitoring for 5 minutes with an update every 3 seconds\nmonitor_network(duration = 5*60, delay = 3)\n```\n\nThis script starts monitoring the network activity for 5 minutes and updates (generates random network data) every 3 seconds. The generate_network_data function can be replaced with real-time data fetching mechanism based on your requirement.\n\nPlease, replace the interact with your real network data. This code won't work right away because the part where the actual network data has to be collected has been omitted. It\u2019s necessary having an understanding of your network infrastructure to accurately create a script such as this."
