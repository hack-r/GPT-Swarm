"Sure, to visualize a network graph, you can use libraries like NetworkX, matplotlib, and nxviz in Python. Here's an example with NetworkX and Matplotlib:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Create a graph\nG = nx.Graph()\n\n# Add edges (connections between nodes). You can also add them individually using G.add_edge('a', 'b')\nedges = [('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('B', 'D'), ('C', 'D'), ('C', 'E'), ('E', 'D'), ('D', 'G'), ('E', 'G')]\nG.add_edges_from(edges)\n\n# Draw the graph\nnx.draw(G, with_labels=True)\nplt.show()\n```\n\nWithout more specific information about the network graph you want to visualize, this is a general example. If you want something more specific, like a directed graph or weighted graph, or with different styles of visualization, please provide more information."
