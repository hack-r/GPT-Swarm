"Sure, to create a mock network dataset in R we will first generate data for \"nodes\" which will represent network devices and \"edges\" which these nodes are connected through.\n\nTo illustrate a network of devices and their interactions, we can use the iGraph package in R. \n\nHere is a simple way to create this mock dataset:\n\n```r\n# Install and load iGraph\ninstall.packages(\"igraph\")\nlibrary(igraph)\n\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Create mock node data (Let's say we have 10 network devices)\nnode_data <- data.frame(\n  node_id = 1:10,\n  device_name = paste0(\"Device_\", 1:10),\n  device_type = sample(c(\"Computer\", \"Server\", \"Router\", \"Switch\"), 10, replace = TRUE)\n)\n\n# Create mock edges data \n# For simplicity, let's create a simple mock data where each device is connected to the device with the next id\nedge_data <- data.frame(\n  from = node_data$node_id,\n  to = c(node_data$node_id[-1], node_data$node_id[1])\n)\n\n# Create a graph from the edge data\ng <- graph_from_data_frame(d = edge_data, vertices = node_data, directed = FALSE)\n\n# Print the graph\nprint(g)\n\n# To visualize the network\nplot(g)\n```\n\nYou can always modify the code to suit the specifics of your use-case. This code simply creates a circular network where each 'device' is connected to two other devices. Note that the function `sample()` is used to randomly assign a device type to each node. The `graph_from_data_frame()` function is used to generate the network graph and `plot()` is used to visually represent the network.\n\nEach row in \"node_data\" represents a device and each row in \"edge_data\" represents a connection between two devices."
