"As an AI, I can certainly help you create a program that generates poems, but it's important to note that programming doesn't have a direct way to ensure the poem communicates the desired emotions or information as this is quite a subjective area. I will suggest a way to use AI technologies to get closer to this goal.\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that could be useful in this case. Sentiment Analysis, a part of NLP, can be used to determine the sentiment of the text (positive, negative or neutral).\n\nHere's an example of how you might create a poem with Python and then analyze its sentiment using the TextBlob library. Note that this just gives the overall sentiment and will not give perfect results, but it might be useful in some cases.\n\nFirstly, install the necessary libraries.\n```python\npip install textblob\npip install nltk\n```\n\nThen the code would look like this:\n\n```python\nfrom textblob import TextBlob\n\n# This should be replaced with your poem generation logic\npoem = \"\"\"\nI wandered lonely as a cloud\nThat floats on high o'er vales and hills,\nWhen all at once I saw a crowd,\nA host, of golden daffodils;\nBeside the lake, beneath the trees,\nFluttering and dancing in the breeze.\n\"\"\"\n\nblob = TextBlob(poem)\n\n# This will output a number between -1 and 1. -1 is negative, 0 is neutral, 1 is positive.\nprint(blob.sentiment.polarity)\n\n```\n\nAgain, please note that this is a simplification and will not capture all nuances of human emotion. Creating AI that can understand and generate human emotion in text is a huge challenge and an active area of research!"
