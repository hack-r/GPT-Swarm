"1. \"Design an R function that reads and writes the IP and MAC addresses and other data associated with all devices connected to a network.\"\n\n2. \"Help me write a function in R language that creates a log of all internet transactions - times, addresses visited, data uploaded and downloaded - for each device.\"\n\n3. \"Provide a script in R that can monitor and control data usage on every connected device. The function should allow setting data limits for each device and either send a warning or disconnect the device if the limit is exceeded.\"\n\n4. \"Guide me in writing an R function that can prioritize network traffic for specified devices or types of data (e.g. video stream, online game) with the optional feature of scheduling certain priority settings for specific times.\"\n\n5. \"Assist in developing a function in R to identify and block unauthorized or suspicious devices connected to the network.\"\n\n6. \"Help me devise a function in R that checks for updates to the router's firmware and installs them if necessary.\"\n\n7. \"Support with writing a function in R that allows the user to customize network settings, such as assigning a static IP address to a specific device.\"\n\n8. \"Help me code a script with R that can generate reports on network activity and performance, with optional alerts for significant changes or problems.\" \n\nPlease note that implementing a home router using R scripting is a formidable task and these prompts are only initial set of tasks. Actual implementation could involve more intricacies and deeper understanding of network protocols, IP routing and MAC addressing. \n\nR isn't typically used for these types of tasks, it might be more appropriate to use Python or a more system-level language for these types of tasks, given their built-in networking libraries and closer integration with system and hardware level interaction."
