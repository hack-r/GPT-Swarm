"Arby's is an American fast-food sandwich restaurant chain known for its roast beef sandwiches, curly fries and an extensive menu offering other delicious items. The company's own slogan, \"We Have The Meats,\" highlights its emphasis on providing high-quality, meat-heavy sandwiches.\n\nBrand History:\n\nArby's was founded by Forrest R. and Leroy Raffel, the Raffel Brothers, in Boardman, Ohio, on July 23, 1964. The name \"Arby's\" is a play on R.B., the initials of the Raffel Brothers. They opened the first Arby\u2019s Restaurant with a focus on freshly sliced, oven-roasted beef sandwiches as a high-quality, quick-service alternative to typical fast food. \n\nArby's was one of the first fast-food establishments to offer a complete \"lite\" menu, with salads and sandwiches under 300 calories and less than 94% fat. Since its inception, Arby's has consistently brought innovation to its menu, introducing many breakthrough items like Curly Fries, Chicken Naturals, and most recently fresh salads with quality meats.\n\nCulture:\n\nArby's has a vibrant and fun-loving company culture. It champions a set of core values known as \"DREAMBIG\" which stand for \"Delight our guests\", \"Respect our team\", \"Excel in all we do\", \"Act with integrity\", \"Make a difference\" and \"Give back\". These values are reflected in their treatment of employees and extend to their interaction with their customers. \n\nThe company also has a strong commitment to corporate social responsibility. The Arby\u2019s Foundation, the independent charitable arm of Arby\u2019s, has donated more than $90 million to youth-related causes since its inception in 1986.\n\nAs of 2021, there are over 3,300 Arby\u2019s restaurants in the United States. In 2020, Inspire Brands, a multi-brand restaurant company, accumulated Arby's in its portfolio alongside other popular brands such as Subway, Dunkin', and Jimmy Johns. \n\nArby's has a reputation for humorous and bold advertising campaigns and has built a cultural presence off of engaging television commercials, unique product offerings, and a strong social media presence. One of their most memorable moments occurred on social media in 2014, when Arby's tweeted a joke at musician Pharrell Williams about his hat, which resembled the company's logo."
