"To test a stopwatch program in R, you should first design a program that would take the start time, end time, and duration of an event.\n\nSo, let's create a simple stopwatch function in R:\n\n```R\nstopwatch <- function(duration_seconds) {\n  start_time <- Sys.time()\n  print(paste(\"Stopwatch started at: \", start_time))\n  \n  Sys.sleep(duration_seconds)  # Makes R pause for specified number of seconds\n  \n  end_time <- Sys.time()\n  print(paste(\"Stopwatch ended at: \", end_time))\n  \n  duration <- end_time - start_time\n  print(paste(\"Actual elapsed time in seconds: \", duration))\n}\n```\n\nThis function uses Sys.time() to get the current time, Sys.sleep() to pause the execution for a certain number of seconds, and then takes a difference between the end time and start time to calculate the elapsed duration.\n\nTo test this function, just call it with a certain number of seconds:\n```R\nstopwatch(5)  # Run stopwatch for 5 seconds\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a very simplified example. Real-world stopwatch applications would include more complex functionalities."
