"Based on the request you've made, I can give a general approach on how it is done. \n\n1. Import Tracks: Load both the instrumental and vocal tracks onto the digital audio workstation (DAW) of your choice. Make sure both tracks are in sync.\n\n2. Audio Levels: Start by adjusting the volume levels of both tracks so they don't overpower each other. Usually, the vocal track should be louder but not to the point that it drowns out the instrumentals entirely. \n\n3. Equalization/EQ: Apply Equalization to each track. This is a process of adjusting various frequencies to achieve a balanced and blended sound. It can help to cut or boost frequencies to make space for all elements of the song - especially important when you're trying to make vocals and instrumentals work well together.\n\n4. Compression: Apply compression to control the dynamic range of the tracks. This is used to maintain a consistent volume by reducing the level of loud sounds or amplifying quiet sounds.\n\n5. Reverb/Delay: Add reverb or delay to create depth and space in the mix. Be careful not to use too much as it may muddy the mix.\n\n6. Panning: Use panning to position elements of the song in the stereo field. This can give the listener a sense of space and can help to make elements of the song more distinct.\n\n7. Mastering: Finally, when you're happy with the balance and mix of the song, apply mastering. This is the process of making the final tweaks to the song to optimize the listening experience across different audio systems.\n\nRemember, mixing and balancing sound is an art and highly subjective. It often relies on your own taste and the style of the song. Always take a break and listen again with fresh ears, this can help you realize mistakes and areas that can be improved."
