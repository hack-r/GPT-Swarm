"As an AI text-based assistant, I'm unable to physically record a song or a scratch track for you. However, I can certainly guide you through the steps on how to do it:\n\n1. Choose a Recording Software: There are many affordable and even free options available like GarageBand for iOS and Audacity for Windows.\n\n2. Set Up Your Equipment: At the basic level, you may need a good quality microphone, headphones, and an audio interface. Connect these to your computer.\n\n3. Open the Recording Software: Start a new project and enable the tracks for recording. Typically, you'll need two tracks - one for vocals and one for the instrument.\n\n4. Record the Instrumental: Usually it's best to start with the instrumental part. Press the record button and play the basic melody of your song.\n\n5. Record the Vocals: Once you're satisfied with the instrumental track, record the vocals on the second track while listening to the instrumental. \n\n6. Playback and Edit: After recording, playback the tracks together. Editing might be necessary to clean up the track and make adjustments where necessary.\n\n7. Save Your Project: Make sure you save your project to prevent any loss of data.\n\nRemember that a scratch track is not meant to be perfect. It's just a rough version of your song to map out the basic structure and the melody line. Good luck with your recording!"
