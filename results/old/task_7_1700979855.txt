"Sure, to create a network graph with the \"igraph\" library in R, you first need to install and load the package. You can then create a graph object with vertex and edge sets.\n\nHowever, you didn't provide the specific dataset or the details about nodes and edges, so I'll illustrate using a generic example:\n\n```R\n# Install and load igraph package\ninstall.packages(\"igraph\")\nlibrary(igraph)\n\n# Create vertex and edge data\nvertices <- data.frame(name=c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\"))\nedges <- data.frame(from=c(\"A\", \"B\", \"A\", \"C\", \"E\"), to=c(\"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"A\"))\n\n# Create graph\ng <- graph_from_data_frame(d=edges, vertices=vertices, directed=F)\n\n# Plot the graph\nplot(g, vertex.size=20, vertex.color=\"cyan\", edge.color=\"black\",\n     edge.width=2, vertex.label=V(g)$name, vertex.label.cex=1.5)\n```\nIn the edge data frame, each row represents a connection between the vertices listed in that row's 'from' and 'to' columns. This code creates an undirected graph, as indicated by the `directed=F` argument. If you want to create a directed graph, you could change this to `directed=T`.\n\nPlease replace with your specific vertices and edges details for a more accurate graph."
