"Since R is more for data analysis and not typically used for parsing network packets, I would suggest using a language like Python with libraries expert at handling this (like Scapy). However, if you insist on using R, a feasible way is to leverage system functionality to call shell commands and perform network packet inspection using tools such as tcpdump. This strategy will only work if R is running in a Unix-like environment (like Linux or MacOS) or in Windows with appropriate Unix-like environment set up.\n\n```r\n# Installing necessary packages\ninstall.packages(\"readr\")\nlibrary(readr)\n\n# Specify the number of packets you want to capture\nnumPackets <- 10\n\n# Run the tcpdump command via system()\ncommand <- paste0(\"tcpdump -c \", numPackets, \" -nn -tttt\")\nsystemOutput <- system(command, intern = TRUE)\n\n# Reformat the output and extract info as a data frame\ndf <- read_table(systemOutput, col_names = FALSE)\n\n# Define a function that extracts IP address and port from string\nextractIpPort <- function(s) {\n  s <- gsub(\"^.*IP \", \"\", s)\n  s <- strsplit(s, \" > \")[[1]]\n  sourceIpPort <- strsplit(s[1], \"\\\\.\")[[1]]\n  sourceIp <- paste(sourceIpPort[1:4], collapse = \".\")\n  sourcePort <- sourceIpPort[5]\n  destIpPort <- strsplit(s[2], \": \")[[1]]\n  destIp <- paste(destIpPort[1:4], collapse = \".\")\n  destPort <- destIpPort[5]\n  return(list(sourceIp = sourceIp, sourcePort = sourcePort, destIp = destIp, destPort = destPort))\n}\n\n# Apply the function to every row\nresults <- lapply(df$X1, extractIpPort)\n\n# Display the results\nresults\n```\n\nPlease ensure you have the necessary permissions to sniff packets on your network interface, and be careful not to violate any legal or ethical guidelines when parsing and inspecting network traffic."
