"Sure! However, keep in mind that R is not really a language for system-level tasks like network connections. R is typically used for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning tasks. \n\nIn operating systems like Windows, it's possible to run command-line instructions using the `system` or `system2` functions. These can theoretically be used to connect to a Wi-Fi network using the `netsh` utility in Windows, but this sort of operation would require administrator privileges and shouldn't generally be done from within R.\n\nHere's a skeleton of what the function might look like:\n\n```R\nconnect_to_network <- function(ssid, password) {\n  command <- paste0('netsh wlan connect ssid=', ssid, ' key=', password)\n  system(command)\n}\n```\n\nPlease note the following issues:\n1. This code has security flaws because it logs the sensitive details (password) which might be accessible via logs to others.\n2. This code might not work as expected without system's admin privileges.\n3. If you are dealing with this level of system control, you'd typically be better off using a language better suited for system-level tasks like Python or a shell script.\n\nAlways remember to never share your sensitive information like network SSID and passwords and handle them with best security practices if it needs to be used within any script."
