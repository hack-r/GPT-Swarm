"Monitoring network activity is an essential part of maintaining a highly available and secure IT infrastructure. Several methods can be used to accomplish this, including logging network traffic, using a network monitoring tool, and analyzing network packets.\n\nBelow is a Python script that uses the Scapy module to monitor network activity and capture packets:\n\n```python\nfrom scapy.all import *\n\ndef packet_capture(packet):\n    print('Source IP: ' + packet[IP].src + ' Destination IP: ' + packet[IP].dst + ' Protocol: ' + packet[IP].proto)\n\nsniff(filter='ip', prn=packet_capture)\n```\n\nThe `filter='ip'` argument specifies that we only want IP packets. The `prn=packet_capture` argument means that for each packet that meets the filter criteria, it will call the `packet_capture` function. This function just prints out the packet\u2019s source and destination IP addresses. \n\nPlease note, to run this for real you'll need root or the equivalent permissions. \n\nBefore running this script, make sure you have the Scapy module installed. If not, install it using pip:\n\n```\npip install scapy\n```\n\nThere are indeed professional tools or softwares like Wireshark, Zabbix, Nagios etc. which are capable of handling complex networking infrastructures and provide more detailed insights.\n\nRemember: Unauthorised network monitoring could potentially be illegal, always ensure to have proper permissions while performing such tasks."
