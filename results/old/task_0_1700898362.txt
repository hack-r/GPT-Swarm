"In R, you can utilize the `readLines()` function to read lines from a text file. Here's a possible script that performs the requested operation:\n\nThe text file (`whitelist.txt`) should be structured like this:\n\n```\n123.456.78.9,80\n213.432.543.21,8080\n98.76.54.32,8000\n```\n\nAn IP address and port are separated by a comma, and each pair of IP address and port is in a new line in the file.\n\nR script:\n\n```R\n# Function to read whitelist IPs and ports from a text file\ngetWhitelist <- function(whitelist_file_path) {\n  lines <- readLines(whitelist_file_path)     # Read lines from file\n  whitelist <- strsplit(lines, \",\")           # Split each line at the comma\n  \n  # Convert the list of vectors to a data frame\n  whitelist_df <- do.call(rbind.data.frame, whitelist)\n  names(whitelist_df) <- c(\"IP\", \"Port\")      # Assign column names\n  \n  return(whitelist_df)\n}\n\n# Test with a whitelist file\nwhitelist <- getWhitelist(\"whitelist.txt\")\nprint(whitelist)\n```\n\nIn this script, we define a function, `getWhitelist()` which reads a file from a provided path, splits each line at the comma to get the IP and port separately, and puts the result in a data frame for easy manipulation. Then, we test the function with a file named \"whitelist.txt\", and print the resulting whitelist.\n\nPlease replace `\"whitelist.txt\"` with the path to your actual file. Make sure your working directory is set appropriately when you run this, or provide a full path to the file."
