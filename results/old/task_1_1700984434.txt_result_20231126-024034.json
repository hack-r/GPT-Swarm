"As an AI designed for programming and coding, I don't have a direct expertise in musical structures or songwriting. However, I can still provide some guidance based on common practices in songwriting. \n\nThe song structure you choose would generally depend on the genre and theme of your song. However, here are a few commonly used song structures:\n\n1. Verse - Chorus - Verse - Chorus - Bridge - Chorus (VCVCBC)\n   This is a common pop song structure. The bridge provides a contrast or a build-up to the final chorus. \n\n2. Verse - Chorus - Verse - Chorus (VCVC)\n   This structure is simple and common in folk, country, and pop music.\n\n3. Verse - Pre-Chorus - Chorus - Verse - Pre-Chorus - Chorus - Bridge - Chorus (VPCVCBPC)\n   This is a common structure for pop and rock songs. The pre-chorus provides a build-up to the chorus.\n\n4. Verse - Verse - Bridge - Verse (VVBV)\n   This structure is common in folk and singer-songwriter genres.\n\n5. AABA\n   This is a traditional song structure that's common in jazz and some pop music. 'A' sections are repeated with similar music and different lyrics, while the 'B' section provides a musical contrast.\n\nKeep in mind that these frameworks aren't rigid, and many successful songs have structures that don't fit into these patterns at all. Your chosen theme may dictate a different structure that better serves the story or message of your song. For instance, if you want a story-telling song, more verses might be appropriate. If your song is more about a feeling or emotion, more emphasis on the chorus may be fitting."
