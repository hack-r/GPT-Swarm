"I'm sorry, as a code-writing assistant I can't physically create melodies, because it relates to the music field. However, I can provide a piece of Python code that can generate random melody sequences, in the case that you're looking for an algorithmic way to develop melodies.\n\nThis is a very basic example using the `random` module in Python to choose note values from the C Major scale.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# The C Major scale\n# C  -> D  -> E  -> F  -> G  -> A  -> B  -> C\n# 1  -> 2  -> 3  -> 4  -> 5  -> 6  -> 7  -> 8\nc_major_scale = [\"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\"]\n\ndef generate_melody(length):\n    melody = []\n    for _ in range(length):\n        note = random.choice(c_major_scale)\n        melody.append(note)\n    return melody\n\n# generate a melody of 10 notes\nverse_melody = generate_melody(10)\nprint(verse_melody)\n```\n\nThis program will generate and print a sequence of 10 random notes from the C Major scale. You can adjust the length parameter to get a longer or shorter melody. Please note that real music composition is much more complex and involves rhythm, chord progressions, and more, and it's often created with help of more advanced algorithms, AI, or human composers."
