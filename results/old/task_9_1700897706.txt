"To stop a stopwatch in R, you can make use of `proc.time()` function. This function gives the current time at the point of function calling. Thus, you can take the difference of times at two different points to note time elapsed i.e., to act as a stopwatch.\n\nHere's some example code:\n\n```R\n# Start the stopwatch\nstart_time <- proc.time()\n\n# Your chunk of code here\n# ...\n\n# Stop the stopwatch\nstop_time <- proc.time()\n\n# Calculate the overall time taken\ntime_taken <- stop_time - start_time\nprint(time_taken)\n```\n\nIn this script, `start_time` marks the time when you started the stopwatch and `stop_time` marks the time when you stopped the stopwatch. The difference `stop_time - start_time` gives the time elapsed between the two timestamps, that is time taken for execution of your code. \n\nPlease replace `# Your chunk of code here` with the actual tasks or code you want to measure the runtime for.\n\nRemember to make sure the above chunk of code is in .R file or R terminal to run it."
