"In R, unfortunately, you can't handle DNS requests directly because it's a statistical programming language and not used for network programming. However, you can use system calls or libraries to execute shell command which can resolve DNS. Below is the example to handle DNS using system \"dig\" command.\n\n```R\n# Define a function for resolving DNS\nresolve_DNS <- function(domain) {\n  # Use system 'dig' command to resolve DNS and capture the output\n  dig_output <- system(paste(\"dig\", domain), intern = TRUE)\n  \n  # Look for the line that contains the IP address\n  ip_line <- grep(\"^;; ANSWER SECTION:\", dig_output)\n  \n  # Parse the IP address from the output line\n  ip <- gsub(\"^.*IN\\\\s+A\\\\s+\", \"\", dig_output[ip_line])\n  \n  # Return the IP address\n  return(ip)\n}\n\n# Usage:\nprint(resolve_DNS(\"google.com\"))\n```\n\nPlease note the above script only works in Unix/LINUX environments. Also, to run the above script, the 'dig' command must be installed. The environment might also need certain permissions to run the system commands. "
