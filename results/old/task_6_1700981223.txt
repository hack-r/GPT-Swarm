"Sure. Here's a basic code snippet in Python to generate a simple poem outline. This is not an actual poem but it gives you an outline on which you can build your poem:\n\n```python\nclass Poem:\n    def __init__(self, theme, lines):\n        self.theme = theme\n        self.lines = lines\n\n    def display_poem(self):\n        print(f\"The theme of this poem is: {self.theme}\\n\")\n        print(\"The Lines of the poem are:\")\n        for i in range(len(self.lines)):\n            print(f\"Line {i+1}: {self.lines[i]}\")\n\npoem_theme = \"Nature\"\npoem_lines = [\"Gentle breeze rustling through the trees,\", \n              \"birds chirping melodies in the mornings,\",\n              \"the river flowing with a tranquil ease,\", \n              \"stars twinkling in the evening's adorning.\"]\n\npoem = Poem(poem_theme, poem_lines)\npoem.display_poem()\n```\nIn this Python code, we're creating a structure for a poem with a specific theme and some lines. Then, we define a method to display our poem. By creating new poem objects, you can plan and structure different poems using this as an outline. \n\nBut if you meant a natural language outline for a poem, a common structure can be:\n\n1. Introduction of the atmosphere or location\n2. Introduction of the main theme or problem\n3. Deepening of the theme or problem\n4. Resolution or conclusion. \n\nA thematic approach could look something like this:\n\n1. An observation or statement about your chosen theme.\n2. How that theme affects the world or people.\n3. Personal connections or anecdotes about the theme.\n4. A universal conclusion or message about the theme.\n\nThe structure typically depends on the poem type such as sonnets, haiku, free verse etc."
