"Based on your context, it seems like you're looking to merge different parts of a song together programmatically. Let's say you have different parts of a song as separate audio files and you want to merge them into a single audio file.\n\nThis sort of task can be done using the PyDub library in Python which is a simple and easy-to-use library to manipulate audio files.\n\nBelow is a basic code example shows how to do it:\n\n```python\nfrom pydub import AudioSegment\n\n# load audio files\npart1 = AudioSegment.from_file(\"part1.mp3\")\npart2 = AudioSegment.from_file(\"part2.mp3\")\npart3 = AudioSegment.from_file(\"part3.mp3\")\n\n# Concatenate audio files\nsong = part1 + part2 + part3\n\n# Export as mp3\nsong.export(\"full_song.mp3\", format=\"mp3\")\n```\n\nIn this example, replace \"part1.mp3\", \"part2.mp3\", \"part3.mp3\" with the actual paths of your audio files. The parts will be concatenated in the order they're added.\n\nPlease note that PyDub works with .wav files out-of-box, but if you want it to work with .mp3 or other format files, you would need ffmpeg to be installed and available in your system PATH.\n\nRemember to install PyDub if you haven't done so:\n\n```sh\npip install pydub\n```\n\nPlease adjust the code as necessary to suit your specific requirements."
