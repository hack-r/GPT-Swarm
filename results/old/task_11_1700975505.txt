"R, as a data-oriented language, does not support low-level system operations like scanning WiFi networks directly. Hence, it is not possible to develop a function in R to scan and list all available WiFi networks.\n\nHowever, you can make system commands from R using system() or system2() functions, which can execute command-line arguments. For example, in a Windows system, you can get a raw output by executing the command 'netsh wlan show network'.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```r\ngetNetworks <- function() {\n  networks <- system('netsh wlan show network', intern = TRUE)\n  print(networks)\n}\n\ngetNetworks()\n```\n\nRemember, this command will only work on Windows, as 'netsh' is a Windows command, and requires the necessary system permissions to execute.\n\nFor macOS, the equivalent command for scanning wifi network is '/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport -s'. For Linux, the 'iwlist' command might be used.\n\nTherefore, in practice, you need to consider OS differences and system permissions when dealing with system command execution in R (or any other language)."
