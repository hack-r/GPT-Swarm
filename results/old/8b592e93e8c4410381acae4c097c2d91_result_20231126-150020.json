"(Verse 1)\nAt the junction of roast beef and cheddar, where flavors intertwine,\nThere stands a place, you know the name, serving real food, not just a sign.\nIt's Arby's where the magic lives, with every bite savored,\nA journey of taste, a tale of the grill, the touch of love sometimes flavored.\n\n(Chorus)\nSauce has a name, it's Arby's' own, it's a flavor revolution,\nWith tang and spice, and everything nice, it's your mouth's taste solution. \n\n(Verse 2)\nTheir meats are slow roasted, to juicy perfection,\nWith 13 hours of tender loving, no need for introspection.\nAnd Arby\u2019s sauce, oh what a treat, a tangy temptation,\nIt's a secret recipe, made only here, sparks taste buds sensation.\n\n(Bridge)\nThe hat may be vintage, but the flavor is new,\nIt's a once in a lifetime, food rendezvous.\nFrom ocean-sprayed merlots to farm-fresh greens,\nAnd everything in between.\n\n(Chorus)\nArby\u2019s, Arby\u2019s, your sauce an inspiration,\nYour recipes passed down generations.\nWith each dollop and pour, a little more lore,\nYour edible handwritten score.\n\n(Outro)\nWe sing in honor of Arby's, where sauce and secrets reside,\nIt's the spirit of family, culinary art and gastronomic pride.\nSo here's to Arby's, to the sauce, to the taste,\nIn the world of fast food, you make haste, but never waste."
