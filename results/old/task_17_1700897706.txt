The `stopwatch` package in itself allows for very precise measurements of elapsed time with very little overhead. However, It doesn't actually have the `start` and `stop` functions as described in the prompt. To accommodate the prompt, a pseudo function was created called `stopwatchOperation` to mimic the described functionality. \n\nIn an actual R package there's no such thing as \"module\", instead we have packages and functions defined within them.\n\nAlternatively, you can choose other R packages for time measurement handling like `systime` or `microbenchmark`, although their usage will be different as they have different sets of functions and methods."
