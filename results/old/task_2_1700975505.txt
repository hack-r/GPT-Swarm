"Given the specification of your task, it seems you want to create a network scanning tool. However, it's extremely important to know that R is not designed to perform such actions. \n\nSuch tasks are typically performed using lower-level languages and systems utilities either built into operating systems or provided by other such system-level tools like Nmap, Netstat etc.\n\nCrucially it's important to know, as such a task can be system intrusive and may violate ethical and legal guidelines if performed without proper permissions, especially if you intend to use this function on a network that doesn't belong to you. \n\nMoreover, if you want to perform such tasks with R, you would need to call these appropriate system-level commands using system functions.\n\nHere is an example of how you might begin to structure such a function by calling system-level commands from within R, though please note that this may not work depending on your system configuration and is provided merely as a conceptual example:\n\n```r\nnetwork_scan <- function() {\n  # For UNIX-like systems, using nmap (if installed on the system):\n  system(\"nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24\", intern = TRUE) # replace with your network\n  # It will return output similar to: \n  # Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-06-21 IST\n  # Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1\n  # Host is up (0.00057s latency).\n  # Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.2\n  # Host is up (0.00013s latency).\n  # Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 2.30 seconds\n}\n\n# Call the function\nnetwork_scan()\n```\n\nIf you wish to develop such tools, I would recommend using system-level scripting languages such as Bash, Python or Perl, which interact more directly with the operating system."
