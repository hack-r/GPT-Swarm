"In order to drive the changes based on the feedback received from the demo, more specific details will be required. However, I can provide you with a general guideline on how to proceed:\n\n1. **Understand the feedback**: This is the first and most critical step. Make sure you understand all the feedback given by the stakeholders in the demo. If you are unsure about anything, ask for clarification.\n\n2. **Prioritize the feedback**: Not all feedback may be equally important. Prioritize based on the impact the changes will have on the project. \n\n3. **Create tasks/sub-tasks**: Based on the feedback, create tasks and sub-tasks. You may want to use project management tools like Jira, Trello, or Asana to keep track of these tasks.\n\n4. **Plan your work**: Based on the tasks you created, plan when and how to implement the changes. You may need to discuss this with your team.\n\n5. **Start making changes**: Once you have a plan, follow it to make the necessary modifications. \n\n6. **Code review and testing**: Before finalizing any changes, make sure your code is reviewed by peers (for any logical or standard-related issues). After any changes, do thorough testing to ensure that everything works as expected.\n\n7. **Documentation**: Update any project documentation to reflect the changes made.\n\n8. **Communicate**: Once the changes have been made, communicate this back to the stakeholders, and organize another demo if necessary. \n\nPlease note, this is a general guide and may need to be adapted as per your project requirements."
