"Sure. Here is a function in R that does exactly what you specified.\n\n```R\nstopStopwatch <- function(start_time) {\n  \n  # Captures the current system time\n  stop_time <- Sys.time()\n  \n  # Calculation of the elapsed time\n  elapsed_time <- stop_time - start_time\n  \n  # Return the elapsed time\n  return(elapsed_time)\n}\n```\nThis function can be used as follows:\n```R\nstart_time <- Sys.time()\nSys.sleep(5) # pauses for 5 seconds \nstopStopwatch(start_time) # this will roughly output 5 seconds\n```\n\nPlease remember that the output will be in seconds by default and it reflects the system's notion of time which includes any time the system was sleeping or waiting for input."
