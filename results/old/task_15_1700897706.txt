"Sure, Here is a simple function in R that fits your description.\n\n```R\nstartStopwatch <- function() {\n  startTime <- Sys.time()\n  return(startTime)\n}\n```\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```R\nstartTime <- startStopwatch()\n```\nAfter running this line of code, `startTime` will contain a timestamp representing the time the function was called (the start time of the stopwatch, in other words)."
