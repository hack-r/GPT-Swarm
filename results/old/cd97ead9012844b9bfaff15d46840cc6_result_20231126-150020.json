Here's a general guideline on how to approach the instrumental arrangement:\n\n1. Start with the Basics: Establish the key elements of your song\u2014like the melody and rhythm. For most songs, a basic arrangement could involve vocals, drums, bass, and guitar or a keyboard instrument.\n\n2. Rhythm Section: This is typically the foundation of most songs and includes rhythm instruments like drums, bass, guitar, or piano. Focus on the beats and rhythmic structures based on the genre of your song. \n\n3. Harmonic Instruments: These will support the melody of your song. They can be introduced through keyboard instruments, guitars, or other harmonic instruments. \n\n4. Melody Instruments: Whether it's a soulful saxophone or a powerful lead guitar, select a lead instrument that echoes or compliments the vocal melody and fits the genre of your music. \n\n5. Layering and Textures: This is about adding depth and color to your song by using a variety of different sounds and instruments. Strings, horns or synth sounds can create a lush soundscape.\n\n6. Dynamics & Variation: Introduce elements that change throughout the song to keep it interesting. This can be done by adding or subtracting instruments, changing the rhythm, or altering the volume of certain elements at different points in the song.\n\nWhen deciding on the instrumental arrangement for a song, it's crucial to keep your target audience and the song\u2019s purpose in mind. Experiment and explore different combinations and instrumentations to see what works best for your song.\nBased on the request you've made, I can give a general approach on how it is done. \n\n1. Import Tracks: Load both the instrumental and vocal tracks onto the digital audio workstation (DAW) of your choice. Make sure both tracks are in sync.\n\n2. Audio Levels: Start by adjusting the volume levels of both tracks so they don't overpower each other. Usually, the vocal track should be louder but not to the point that it drowns out the instrumentals entirely. \n\n3. Equalization/EQ: Apply Equalization to each track. This is a process of adjusting various frequencies to achieve a balanced and blended sound. It can help to cut or boost frequencies to make space for all elements of the song - especially important when you're trying to make vocals and instrumentals work well together.\n\n4. Compression: Apply compression to control the dynamic range of the tracks. This is used to maintain a consistent volume by reducing the level of loud sounds or amplifying quiet sounds.\n\n5. Reverb/Delay: Add reverb or delay to create depth and space in the mix. Be careful not to use too much as it may muddy the mix.\n\n6. Panning: Use panning to position elements of the song in the stereo field. This can give the listener a sense of space and can help to make elements of the song more distinct.\n\n7. Mastering: Finally, when you're happy with the balance and mix of the song, apply mastering. This is the process of making the final tweaks to the song to optimize the listening experience across different audio systems.\n\nRemember, mixing and balancing sound is an art and highly subjective. It often relies on your own taste and the style of the song. Always take a break and listen again with fresh ears, this can help you realize mistakes and areas that can be improved.\nAs an AI text-based assistant, I'm unable to physically record a song or a scratch track for you. However, I can certainly guide you through the steps on how to do it:\n\n1. Choose a Recording Software: There are many affordable and even free options available like GarageBand for iOS and Audacity for Windows.\n\n2. Set Up Your Equipment: At the basic level, you may need a good quality microphone, headphones, and an audio interface. Connect these to your computer.\n\n3. Open the Recording Software: Start a new project and enable the tracks for recording. Typically, you'll need two tracks - one for vocals and one for the instrument.\n\n4. Record the Instrumental: Usually it's best to start with the instrumental part. Press the record button and play the basic melody of your song.\n\n5. Record the Vocals: Once you're satisfied with the instrumental track, record the vocals on the second track while listening to the instrumental. \n\n6. Playback and Edit: After recording, playback the tracks together. Editing might be necessary to clean up the track and make adjustments where necessary.\n\n7. Save Your Project: Make sure you save your project to prevent any loss of data.\n\nRemember that a scratch track is not meant to be perfect.

However, I can surely guide you through the process.\n\nHere's a basic outline of the steps you could take:\n\n1. Find a quiet, secluded area for your recording to ensure unwanted sounds are not captured.\n   \n2. Test your microphone to find the optimal volume level and distance from your mouth. You need to check if the audio input is not too quiet or too loud, or it may distort the final recording.\n   \n3. Use a pop filter to prevent breath sounds and syllable pops from marring the recording.\n   \n4. Warm up your voice with some light vocal exercises. It's important that your voice doesn't get strained in the middle of the track.\n   \n5. Start recording the song. Try to stay calm and maintain your rhythm and pitch. You also need to be expressive to convey the song's emotions.\n   \n6. Always keep saving your file on every step to avoid losing any data if your recording software crashes or you experience a power cut.\n   \n7. Perform several takes. Normally, the first take is not the perfect one, so do as many as you can.\n   \n8. Listen carefully to your recorded track. Ideally, put some time between the recording session and playback, as this can help you hear nuances you may have missed.\n   \n9. Edit your track as necessary. With most modern audio software, you can cut out unwanted noise, adjust pitch and timing, and even change the tone of your vocal.\n   \n10. Once you are satisfied with your final take, save your file and export it in your preferred format.\n   \nRemember, practice makes perfect! If you aren't completely happy with your vocal track, try again another day.\n(Chorus)\nOh, Arby's sauce, you spice up my meal,\nWith your tangy twist, I can't help but feel,\nEvery bite I take, you make it so real,\nArby's sauce, you've got that irresistible appeal.\n\nOh, Arby's sauce, in you I trust,\nYou turn every meal into a gust of gust,\nYour flavor ride's always a must,\nArby's sauce, you're the secret to every crust.\nArby's is an American fast-food sandwich restaurant chain known for its roast beef sandwiches, curly fries and an extensive menu offering other delicious items. The company's own slogan, \"We Have The Meats,\" highlights its emphasis on providing high-quality, meat-heavy sandwiches.\n\nBrand History:\n\nArby's was founded by Forrest R. and Leroy Raffel, the Raffel Brothers, in Boardman, Ohio, on July 23, 1964. The name \"Arby's\" is a play on R.B., the initials of the Raffel Brothers. They opened the first Arby\u2019s Restaurant with a focus on freshly sliced, oven-roasted beef sandwiches as a high-quality, quick-service alternative to typical fast food. \n\nArby's was one of the first fast-food establishments to offer a complete \"lite\" menu, with salads and sandwiches under 300 calories and less than 94% fat. Since its inception, Arby's has consistently brought innovation to its menu, introducing many breakthrough items like Curly Fries, Chicken Naturals, and most recently fresh salads with quality meats.\n\nCulture:\n\nArby's has a vibrant and fun-loving company culture. It champions a set of core values known as \"DREAMBIG\" which stand for \"Delight our guests\", \"Respect our team\", \"Excel in all we do\", \"Act with integrity\", \"Make a difference\" and \"Give back\". These values are reflected in their treatment of employees and extend to their interaction with their customers. \n\nThe company also has a strong commitment to corporate social responsibility. The Arby\u2019s Foundation, the independent charitable arm of Arby\u2019s, has donated more than $90 million to youth-related causes since its inception in 1986.\n\nAs of 2021, there are over 3,300 Arby\u2019s restaurants in the United States. In 2020, Inspire Brands, a multi-brand restaurant company, accumulated Arby's in its portfolio alongside other popular brands such as Subway, Dunkin', and Jimmy Johns. \n\nArby's has a reputation for humorous and bold advertising campaigns and has built a cultural presence off of engaging television commercials, unique product offerings, and a strong social media presence. One of their most memorable moments occurred on social media in 2014, when Arby's tweeted a joke at musician Pharrell Williams about his hat, which resembled the company's logo.\nMastering a song is the final step in producing a song before it's ready for distribution. Here are some steps to master your song:\n\n1. **Prepare Your Mix**: Before starting the mastering process, you should ensure that your mix is perfect. Make sure there are no clipping or distortion, and all levels are balanced.\n\n2. **Import Into Mastering Software**: Get your music into your preferred mastering software. This could be software built specifically for mastering, like iZotope's Ozone, or a more general digital audio workstation (DAW) like Ableton, Logic, or Pro Tools.\n\n3. **Make Any Necessary Adjustments**: Even perfectly mixed songs might need some tweaking in the mastering stage. This might be adjusting the equalization (EQ), making small tweaks to the stereo width or adding extra saturation for warmth.\n\n4. **Compression**: Use compression to balance out the dynamics of your song. This reduces the range between the loudest and quietest parts of the song.\n\n5. **Limiting**: A limiter is used to boost the level of your track and give it a commercial loudness. It shouldn't be used too intensely as it can cause distortion.\n\n6. **Reference Tracks**: Use a reference track that's similar in style and sound to your track. Compare your song to the reference track throughout your mastering process to ensure you're on the right track.\n\n7. **Export**: Finally, when you're happy with everything, you need to export your track. Don't forget to dither if you're bouncing it down to a lower bit depth than the one you were mastering in.\n\n8. **Quality Check**: Check the final product on various speakers and headphones, since your song needs to sound good on all types of devices. \n\n9. **Metadata**: Some mastering platforms give you the option to include metadata in your song. This could include the title, artist, album, and track number.\n\n10. **Evaluate**: Before releasing, take some time to evaluate the mastered version. If you're not satisfied, you can always make adjustments.\n\nRemember, if you're not confident in mastering your music yourself, you can always hire a professional to master your track for you.\n\nNote: The purpose of mastering is to balance the stereo mix, make your music sound great on a variety of speakers and earbuds, and ensure that your song is ready for replication and distribution.\nArby\u2019s Sauce: \n\nArby's Sauce is a signature sauce served by American fast food sandwich restaurant chain Arby's.
