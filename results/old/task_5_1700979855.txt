"Sure. Here's a short R code snippet that installs and imports the 'igraph' and 'ggplot2' libraries.\n\n```R\n# Installing required packages \ninstall_packages_if_needed = function(packages) {\n    new_packages = packages[!(packages %in% installed.packages()[, \"Package\"])]\n    if(length(new_packages)) \n        install.packages(new_packages, dependencies = TRUE)\n}\n\n# Specify the packages 'igraph' and 'ggplot2'\npackages = c('igraph', 'ggplot2')\n\n# Call the function to install the packages\ninstall_packages_if_needed(packages)\n\n# Loading or Importing the required packages\nlibrary(igraph)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n\nPlease replace 'igraph' and 'ggplot2' with any package that you would like to install and import.\n\nThis code first checks whether each desired package is already installed. If it is not, it installs the package. It finally loads the package for use. \n\nRemember to execute the code with \"packages <- c('igraph', 'ggplot2')\" (or your specified packages) only once to install the packages. In subsequent uses, you need to execute only \"library('packagename')\" code to import the package."
