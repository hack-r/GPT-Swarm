"Sure, here's a basic example of how you might structure this function. This assumes that you have some kind of data frame that includes device IDs, data usage, and downtime. \n\n```R\n# Sample data frame \n# Replace this with your real data\ndata <- data.frame(\n  device = c('Device1', 'Device2', 'Device1', 'Device2', 'Device1', 'Device2'),\n  usage = c(200, 150, 230, 180, 210, 160), \n  downtime = c(1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1)\n)\n    \n# Function to compute network statistics\ngetNetStats <- function(data){\n  # Data usage per device\n  usage_per_device <- aggregate(data$usage, by=list(Category=data$device), FUN=sum)\n  names(usage_per_device) <- c(\"Device\", \"Total Usage\")\n  \n  # Overall data usage\n  overall_usage <- sum(data$usage)\n  \n  # Downtime per device\n  downtime_per_device <- aggregate(data$downtime, by=list(Category=data$device), FUN=sum)\n  names(downtime_per_device) <- c(\"Device\", \"Total Downtime\")\n  \n  # Overall downtime\n  overall_downtime <- sum(data$downtime)\n  \n  list(\n    UsagePerDevice = usage_per_device,\n    OverallUsage = overall_usage,\n    DowntimePerDevice = downtime_per_device,\n    OverallDowntime = overall_downtime\n  )\n}\n\n# Running the function\nnet_stats <- getNetStats(data)\n```\n\nThis function first calculates the total data used per device with the `aggregate` function, then sums all the data usage to get the overall usage. It does the same for downtime. The results are returned as a list.\n\nYou may need to adjust this depending on your actual needs and the nature of your data."
