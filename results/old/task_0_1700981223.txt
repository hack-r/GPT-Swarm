"Poetry is an artistic form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, prosaic ostensible meaning. The general structure and rules of a poem vary greatly according to the type of poetry; however, some basic concepts are common to nearly all forms.\n\n1. **Lines and Verses**: A poem's basic building block is a line, Segments arranged in verses or stanzas. A stanza may have two to several lines. \n\n2. **Rhythm and Meter**: The rhythm of a poem is determined by the syllables in a line and where the stresses fall. The meter is the basic rhythmic structure of a verse.\n\n3. **Rhyme Schemes**: Referring to the pattern or sequence in which end-rhymes occur, rhymes are often classified by where they fall in the stanza or line. The most common rhyme schemes are the couplet (AABB), the triplet (AAA), and the quatrain (ABAB or ABBA).\n\n4. **Imagery and Language**: Poets use figurative language to create images in the reader's mind and to express emotions and ideas.\n\n5. **Themes and Subjects**: Poems often deal with universal themes and subjects, such as love, death, time, beauty, tragedy, etc.\n\n6. **Sound Devices**: Poets use various sound devices, such as alliteration (repeat of beginning consonant sounds), assonance (repeat of vowel sounds), consonance (repeating final consonant sounds), and onomatopoeia (use of words that mimic the sounds they describe).\n\n7. **Form and Structure**: There are various forms of poetry, including sonnet, haiku, limerick, epic, ode, ballad, etc. Each of these forms follows its unique structure, line count, rhyme scheme, etc. \n\n8. **Tone and Mood**: The tone is the poet's attitude towards the poem's speaker, reader, and subject matter, as interpreted by the reader, while the mood is what the reader feels while reading.\n\nRemember, although these are general structure and rules of poetry, poets often deviate from these rules in the creative process."
