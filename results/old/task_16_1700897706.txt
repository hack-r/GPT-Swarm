"Here is a simple way of creating a command line user interface for a stopwatch program in R.\n\nFirst, we create the stopwatch function:\n\n```R\nstopwatch <- function(){\n  start_time <- Sys.time()\n  readline(prompt=\"Press [enter] to stop\")\n  end_time <- Sys.time()\n  \n  time_diff <- end_time - start_time\n  cat(\"Elapsed time: \", time_diff, \"\\n\")\n}\n```\n\nHere's a user interface that allows users to control the stopwatch:\n\n```R\nwhile(TRUE){\n  cat(\"\\n1. Start Stopwatch\\n\")\n  cat(\"2. Exit Program\\n\")\n\n  option <- as.integer(readline(prompt=\"\\nPlease enter an option (1, 2): \"))\n\n  if(option == 1){\n    stopwatch()\n  } else if(option == 2){\n    break\n  } else {\n    cat(\"Invalid option. Please try again.\\n\")\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis program displays options to either start the stopwatch or exit the program. If the user chooses to start the stopwatch, it will track the time until the user presses enter, then display the elapsed time. If the user chooses to exit the program, it will terminate the while loop and end the program. It runs continuously until the user decides to exit. Please note that this is a simple stopwatch and does not contain features like \"pause\" or \"lap\" etc."
